They allow for homeschooled students &#x26; students without a schoool-led team to participate in FIRST robotics competitions!</p>\n<p>I joined to be a programming mentor for Chicago Knights initially in 2019 - and found that I was able to help more when I was informed that a sister team was being created for the First Lego league. I volunteered to be the lead coach for the Lego League team and facilitated learning &#x26; build sessions for kids aged from 8 ~ 14 in building a robot to compete in the competition through out fall and winter of 2019. </p>\n<p>The kids loved building the robot with legos and programming the robot in python! It was amazing and a humbling experience watching them grow, learning the syntax and problem solving to accomplish things by programming. I actually learned from the kids about Programming while teaching them because they brought a fresh view to how they approach problems. Near the end of 2019, we attended the region competition and although we didn’t score the most points - we were the rookie team that won the Rising Star award! With what we learned in 2019, I hope we can continue to build on it and do even better in 2020!</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/1d0b3cada6c49198d2e47e380a71f3b4/ac99c/awards.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative;
