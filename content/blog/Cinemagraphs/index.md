Cinemagraphs are basically gifs - with the primary focus frozen in time while the background loops. 

I've found a deep love for making cinemagraphs from some of my favorite moments in films. Each capturing a moment that is timelessly moving that evokes some emotion within me

Here's a beautiful moment where the main character looks towards a mirrored world to her own - wondering how her life turned out in that other world.
