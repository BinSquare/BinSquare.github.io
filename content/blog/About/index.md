BinBin's bin is a personal website where I post everything that I'd like to share about what I'm working on or fasinating information I came across!

> Here's a fun page I found about the [Timeline of the far future](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_far_future) frin wikipedia. Fasinating isn't it? The most amazing thing I took from that timeline is that.. in 50,000 years - the Earth will be sent back to the ice age, regardless of global warming.
