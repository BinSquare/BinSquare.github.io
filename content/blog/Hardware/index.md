This is a post I wrote up for my company Ekta Flow about how I used 3D printing to breathe life into an old bicycle frame. The old bicycle frame used an out of manufacturing part for shifting and with the nonstandard tube size, a suitable replacement was incredibly hard to come by. But with a little ingenuity and experimentation - a 3D printed cable stop was invented to save the day!

The first year was all about &nbsp;general education courses - so I didn&rsquo;t really have any practical knowledge in anything. I had been applying exclusively to engineering companies before I noticed an ad by chance on craigslist - a posting for a bicycle builder at Kozy&rsquo;s Cyclery in Chicago. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">The posting called for experience in bicycle repair and build. I had no experience in either of those things &nbsp;- so obviously, I applied! It would be a different experience and definitely wasn&rsquo;t be an expected experience I&rsquo;d have in my life. But I&rsquo;ve always loved riding my bicycles so I figured, some variety would be welcomed!</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">&nbsp;With some help from google clip art of gears &amp; microsoft paint to dazzle my cover letter &amp; resume - I managed to get an interview.

I was taught how to build and eventually fix bicycles by the friendly senior mechanics in the store. Summer flew by quickly, I would go home hot, exhausted and sweating everyday but I loved it. </span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Even after schooling started, I to tinker and mess with bikes.

It was a premium frame for it&rsquo;s time, but it </span><span class="c3">was missing an out-of-production part. The part in question was a Suntour cyclone shifter which also acted as a cable stop, crucial for accurate gear changing. I spent weeks searching for the shifter and alternatives, even with Cannondale support telling me that the best chance was finding that Suntour shifter. Without that shifter, I was stuck without a way to get the shifting working and hopelessly out of luck in getting this frame to ride again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 340.50px; height: 340.50px;"><img alt="" src="./image1.jpg" style="width: 340.50px; height: 340.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">The missing part to complete the bike resurrection.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Or was I?</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Since I updated all the old parts to use modern Shimano 105 components, the shifting mechanism was integrated with the brakes via Shimano&rsquo;s STi.

I already had the knowledge to make what I needed.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">I fired up my student version of AutoCad Inventor and went to work.

By next summer, while my peers were looking at internships at engineering companies such as Boeing or Northrop Grumman, I was looking forward to another summer back in the shop with the hilarious senior mechanics. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I still think back that applying to the craigslist job posting as the genesis of the tinkerer inside me. Although the experience was alike to tasting spice for me, it also awoke a love towards creating and fixing things. And that has shaped my life and career choices ever since - all thanks to a little spice of life, variety.</span></p></body></html>
