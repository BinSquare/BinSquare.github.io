This is a post I wrote up for my company Ekta Flow about how I used 3D printing to breathe life into an old bicycle frame. The old bicycle frame used an out of manufacturing part for shifting and with the nonstandard tube size, a suitable replacement was incredibly hard to come by. But with a little ingenuity and experimentation - a 3D printed cable stop was invented to save the day!
